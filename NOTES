Explained variance percentage graph shows that about top 20 eigenvectors account for > 80% variance
2 kids of preliminary labelings - 1) distance from mean of cluster to each of the seed groups. 
    2) distance from mean of cluster to each of the seed similarity groups
Accuracy went up from 4% to 26% after using 30 components instead of 5. down to 9% at 100 components. Shoulder probably around 15
When using seeds to generate initial centroids for kmeans, find that seeds themselves move out of the clusters they were initially in

TODO:
    Basic supervised model
    Seed_sets extended using similarity graph (if improvement then that means seeds are outliers in their digit class)
    Scale by eigenvalue to get more realistic difference estimate
